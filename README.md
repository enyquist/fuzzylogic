Fuzzy Logic Overview
====================

Implementation of fuzzy logic in the context of artificial life. It delves into various aspects of fuzzy sets, operations on them, and reasoning using them. Here's a summarized breakdown of the provided content:

## Features

* Membership Functions: `fuzzylogic/mf/`
* Connectives: `fuzzylogic/connectives/`
* Defuzzification: `fuzzylogic/defuzz/`
* Linguistic Hedges:
  `fuzzylogic/hedges/`
* T-CoNorms: `fuzzylogic/tconorms/`
* T-Norms: `fuzzylogic/tnorms/`

## Installation and Setup

Assumes you have Python3.10 and python3.10-venv installed.

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/enyquist/fuzzylogic.git
```

Navigate to the directory:

```sh
cd fuzzylogic
```

Create venv:

```sh
make init
```

## Explore Data

See what the `fuzzylogic` module has to offer in `notebooks/demo.ipynb`. More to come!
